title: ESX Legacy Installation
---


<h4 align='center'>You should only be manually updating your ESX if you have a modified version already, in which case it's assumed you have a brain.<br><br>
This guide will only link to the lines you will need to modify, assuming you are using ESX Legacy from the official repository.<br><br>
Furthermore, I am only linking the <b>bare minimum</b> for inventory support.<br><br></h4>

## This is no longer possible.

<h4 align='center'>If this confused you, just <b><a href='https://github.com/5mLucifer/es_extended'>download the fork</a></b>.</h4>
