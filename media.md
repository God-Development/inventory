### Set weapons to require a specific license to purchase (includes 'weapon license' by default)

### Restrict purchasing items for a specific job grade

### Different ammo calibres for each gun, and only load based on the clip size

* With optional config to toggle auto-reloading when the gun reaches 0 ammo
* Improved optimisation for updating with the server - don't trigger events on each shot (or frame in the case of fire extinguishers)
* Support for throwable items such as molotovs, baseballs, etc.

### Create a serial number for weapons, with blacklisted three letter codes for police, ems, etc.

### Ammo has weight, so of course a loaded gun is heavier
