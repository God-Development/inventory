<h2 align='center'>Recommended resources with inventory support</h2>


## Free Resources

### LegacyFuel (needs to be updated, likely has bugs)
* Updated to support the jerry can as an item
* Fuel is the item durability

[Download](https://github.com/thelindat/LegacyFuel)


### QRP ID Cards
* Generates identification (with support for licenses too) with full metadata
* Use the item to show it to nearby players
* Generate a mugshot and attach it as metadata
* Add expiry dates for licenses
* This is a development resource, you still need to set it up for how you want it

### QRP Hunting (outdated at the moment but should work)
- Fork of [Rio's hunting](https://github.com/Rio358/hunting)
- Supports item metadata and drop creation
- Players can skin any dead animal instead of having to kill it
- Uses [state bags](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/networking/state-bags/) to prevent multiple players from skinning

## Paid Resources
I do not typically recommend buying resources, however high quality unobfuscated releases are an obvious exception.

### Loaf Housing
- Very popular and was updated to remove obfuscation fairly recently
- Includes built-in support for the inventory through the config
- (Coming soon) Slots set on a prop-by-prop basis (based on [SHIN's snippet](https://discord.com/channels/813030955598086174/816673612621938759/857387803435073557))
